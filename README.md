Finally, with the aid of javascript, I am creating an application for a video player. With this project, I've finally figured out how to make a video player. I've also included the most crucial feature, which is that the movie must play in the video player whenever a user uploads a video from any folder or file.
Here, I'm using the File Reader class to create this kind of movie player and I'm trying to keep the code quality up to date.
Making the least latency web application is my goal.
